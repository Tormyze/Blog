            </details>

            <p style="text-indent: 30px;">This is a blog where you're gonna find random thoughts that came to my mind. Maybe I'll tell you stories, maybe facts, maybe things about life. Don't hesitate to navigate throughout the place. I hope you really enjoy it!</p>
        </div>

            <details>
                <summary>Why should I read it?</summary>
            </details>

            <p style="text-indent: 30px;">Well, everyone sits sometimes and start to think about any inimaginable kind of things. I'm a person who does it a lot of times and I truly believe that you're maybe gonna identify yourself with it. So, if you are here right now, would you accept my invite to explore all of this?</p>

            <details>
                <summary>Can I write my own posts here?</summary>
            </details>

            <p style="text-indent: 30px;">Here is a special place to me where I can express my ideas, so I'm afraid that you can't let your own posts. Although, you can leave comments about my posts or even rate them through the options on the top of this page. C'mon, I promise it'll be exciting.</p>
